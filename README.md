# ChatGPT File Converter
## Overview
The ChatGPT File Converter is a Python program that streamlines interactions with the ChatGPT model. It simplifies the process of splitting files, attaching prompts to each segment, sending them to the ChatGPT model for processing, and then concatenating the responses into a final output file.

## Features
- **File Splitting**: Easily divide input files into smaller segments.
- **Prompt Attachment**: Load and append your prompt file to each file segment.
- **ChatGPT Interaction**: Streamlined interaction with the ChatGPT model to obtain responses for each segment.
- **Response Concatenation**: Reassemble the responses into a coherent output file.

## Usage
1. **Installation**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Setup**: Install the necessary dependencies by running:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configuration**: Customize your settings in the config.yaml file, specifying the input file, output file, and any other desired parameters.

4. **Execution**: Run the program using the following command:

    ```bash
    python chatgpt_file_converter.py
    ```

5. **Review Results**: Once the program finishes, you will find the concatenated responses in the specified output file.
